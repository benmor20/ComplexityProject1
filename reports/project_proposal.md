# Extending the Schelling Model into a Continuous Space
## Mira Flynn and Ben Morris, Complexity Science Fall 2021

1) A meaningful title (not "Project Proposal"), and the full names of the authors.

2) An abstract that identifies the topics you intend to investigate and the tools you plan to use.

With this project, we want to further investigate the Schelling model of segregation. We will recreate experiments from several papers that include Schelling's original model and an extension of varying vision distance of each cell. After investigating those models, we want to explore cell values in a continuous space between the two extreme values. We plan on using Python as our main tool, likely utilizing some common packages such as NumPy.

3) An annotated bibliography of 1-3 papers that relate to your topic and/or tools.  Explain what the papers are about, what experiments they report, and what their primary conclusions are.

[Models of Segregation](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1823701.pdf)

Thomas C. Schelling (1969)

Schelling introduces a new type of segregation model consisting of two types of cells (not including empty cells). Each cell prefers to have more than half of its neighbors of the same type, and will move to an empty cell if the empty cell fits its preferences. This model has cells with only minor preferences, but produces very high segregation nonetheless. The only stable states are ones with high segregation. This new model offers an explanation for how segregation occurs by setting up several reasonable rules and showing a behavior that is prevalent in the real world.

Alexander J. Laurie, Narendra K. Jaggi (2003) 

Laurie and Jaggi extend the Schelling Segregation Model by adding an extra parameter R - the vision, or the range houses each agent looks at when determining whether to move. They find that contrary to the original Schelling model, certain values of R produce stable, integrated societies. The use a metric to measure total segregation and, through many simulations, find that certain values of R and p (percent of people each agent would like to be the same in their neighborhood) actually lowers this metric compared to Schelling’s original report. This serves as both an explanation and a design – it explains how integrated societies could exist, and provides some ideas (none fully fleshed out, but still gives some) on how to create we can get closer to this type of society in practice. 

4) Present 1-3 experiments from these papers that you plan to replicate and 1-3 extensions or variations of those experiments you are considering.

We will recreate experiments from several papers that include Schelling's original model and an extension of varying vision distance of each cell. After investigating those models, we want to explore cell values in a continuous space between the two extreme values.

5) Sketch what the results from these experiments might look like, possibly using a cartoon of a graphical result.

6) Explain how you will interpret the results; for example, "If the power spectrum on a log-log scale is approximately linear, we will estimate its slope.  If that slope is near 1, we will conclude that the time series generated by model resembles pink noise."

7) Identify causes for concern.  Review the criteria for what makes a good project and identify any areas where your project might be problematic.

8) Outline next steps.  For each team member, what do you plan to work on immediately?  For the team, what do you think you can get done in the first week?  Consider using GitHub Projects to make a kanban board to track tasks.
