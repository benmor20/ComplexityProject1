# Hunger Games Draft Review
## Ben Morris
Review of [Hunger Games](https://github.com/Winterbl00m/ComplexityScience_Project1/blob/main/reports/draft_report.md)

**Question:  What is your understanding of the experiment the team is replicating?  What question does it answer?  How clear is the team's explanation?**

They are trying to simulate a large series of truels (3-person duels) and see when the strongest players win. In a single truel, it is most often the second stongest who wins, since the two weakest will likely team against the strongest first. This does not hold for large networks of truels. This explanation in their abstract is pretty clear.

**Methodology: Do you understand the methodology?  Does it make sense for the question?  Are there limitations you see that the team did not address?**

The methodology is sensible and easy to understand. However, they are missing an explaination of Monte-Carlo simulations, which are mentioned several times through the paper. It would be good to include a brief description of what they are.

**Results: Do you understand what the results are (not yet considering their interpretation)?  If they are presented graphically, are the visualizations effective?  Do all figures have labels on the axes and captions?**

I understand it for the most part, though the visualizations could be formatted a bit better - include just the graph, not the full window, and add captions apart from what is mentioned in the paper itself. Also, labelling axis red, blue, and black is a bit unclear, especially since the order is weakest to smallest in your bar graphs. I'd consider either making a stacked bar chart like in the original paper and/or labelling the bars with the marksmanship instead of the letters.

**Interpretation: Does the draft report interpret the results as an answer to the motivating question?  Does the argument hold water?**

The results so far mostly center around how the original paper implemented their model and any possible shortcomings there. While it does answer the question in a way that makes sense, the focus seems to be elsewhere. I suggest phrasing it in such a way where the main issue is still who survives (and any impact shooting order may have on that), and maybe mention the weird way the original paper did it as an aside.

**Replication: Are the results in the report consistent with the results from the original paper?  If so, how did the authors demonstrate that consistency?  Is it quantitative or qualitative?**

The results are not consistent with that of the original paper, though they seemed to have found the discrepancy. The difference is qualitative, but there is likely a simple statistical test they can run to make the argument for a difference in a more quantitative way

**Extension: Does the report explain an extension to the original experiment clearly?  Can it answer an interesting question that the original experiment did not answer?**

The extension is explained and is interesting but they have not yet had the chance to implement it.

**Progress: Is the team roughly where they should be at this point, with a replication that is substantially complete and an extension that is clearly defined and either complete or nearly so?**

Replication is complete and though they have not yet produced results for their extension that is likely fine given the trouble they had with replicaiton.

**Presentation: Is the report written in clear, concise, correct language?  Is it consistent with the audience and goals of the report?  Does it violate any of the recommendations in my style guide?**

For the most part, yes. Obviously the bullet points should be made into complete sentences for the final, but any other suggestions I have are somewhat nit-picky. For example, all the titles are the same, and while they do show similar things, they should still probably be different because they aren't the same graph. Other suggestions (captions, focus) I already mentioned above.

**Mechanics: Is the report in the right directory with the right file name?  Is it formatted professionally in Markdown?  Does it include a meaningful title and the full names of the authors?  Is the bibliography in an acceptable style?**

Yes, yes, yes, yes
